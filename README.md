# Velocity Anomalies: Pull-up & Push-down (Streamlit)

A tiny, intuitive sandbox focused **only** on velocity anomalies and their effect on seismic time structure.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features
- 2-layer model with optional seabed rugosity.
- A single velocity lens (low-V or high-V) to demonstrate push-down vs pull-up.
- Velocity model, timeâ€“depth curves, and zero-offset synthetic wiggles.

## ðŸš€ Run locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
